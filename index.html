      <h3 class="color-blue">Introduction</h3>
      <p class="p-small">This notice applies across all websites that we own and operate and all services we provide, including our online services products, and any other apps or services we may offer (for example, events or training). For the purpose of this notice, we’ll just call them our ‘services’.<br>‍<br>When we say ‘personal data’ we mean identifiable information about you, like your name, email, address, telephone number, bank account details, payment information, credit card details,  support queries, and so on. If you can’t be identified (for example, when personal data has been aggregated and anonymised) then this notice doesn’t apply.<br>‍<br>We may need to update this notice from time to time. Where a change is significant, we’ll make sure we let you know – usually by sending you an email.</p>
      <h3 class="color-blue">Who are ‘we’?</h3>
      <p class="p-small">When we refer to ‘<strong>we</strong>’ (or ‘<strong>our</strong>’ or ‘<strong>us</strong>’), that means CT4 Pty Limited and all its wholly owned subsidiaries. Our headquarters are in Australia but we operate and have offices all over the world. Address details for all CT4 offices are available on our contacts us page.<br>‍<br>For European Union data protection purposes, when we act as a controller in relation to your personal data, CT4 Europe Limited (Company No: 09357367) is our representative in the European Union.</p>
      <h3 class="color-blue">Our principles of data protection</h3>
      <p class="p-small">Our approach to data protection is built around four key principles. They’re at the heart of everything we do relating to personal data.<br>‍<br><strong>Transparency: </strong>We take a human approach to how we process personal data by being open, honest and transparent.<br>‍<br><strong>Enablement: </strong>We enable connections and efficient use of personal data to empower productivity and growth.<br>‍<br><strong>Security: </strong>We champion industry leading approaches to securing the personal data entrusted to us.<br>‍<br><strong>Stewardship: </strong>We accept the responsibility that comes with processing personal data.</p>
      <h3 class="color-blue">How we collect your data</h3>
      <p class="p-small">When you visit our websites or use our services, we collect personal data. The ways we collect it can be broadly categorised into the following:<br>‍<br><strong>Information you provide to us directly: </strong>When you visit or use some parts of our websites and/or services we might ask you to provide personal data to us. For example, when you sign up for a subscription, join us on social media, take part in training and events, contact us with questions or request support. If you don’t want to provide us with personal data, you don’t have to, but it might mean you can’t use some parts of our websites or services.<br>‍<br><strong>Information we collect automatically: </strong>We collect some information about you automatically when you visit our websites or use our services, like your IP address and device type. We also collect information when you navigate through our websites and services, including what pages you looked at and what links you clicked on. This information is useful for us as it helps us get a better understanding of how you’re using our websites and services so that we can continue to provide the best experience possible (e.g., by personalising the content you see).<br>Some of this information is collected using cookies and similar tracking technologies..<br>‍<br><strong>Information we get from third parties: </strong>The majority of information we collect, we collect directly from you. Sometimes we might collect personal data about you from other sources, such as publicly available materials or trusted third parties like our marketing and research partners. We use this information to supplement the personal data we already hold about you, in order to better inform, personalise and improve our services, and to validate the personal data you provide.<br>‍<br>Where we collect personal data, we’ll only process it:</p>
      <ul role="list" class="mtb-15">
